# AI in Retail Business  
## Smarter Stock Recommender (Seasonal Menu Version with Loop)

---

### Overview

The **Smarter Stock Recommender** helps retail businesses make smarter inventory decisions using Artificial Intelligence (AI).  
It predicts **seasonal product demand** (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) and recommends which products to **restock** based on your sales and inventory data.

The program runs in a simple menu format — you can analyze multiple seasons in one session, and it only stops when you choose to exit.

---

## Features

Predicts seasonal sales using an AI model  
Recommends stock reorder quantities  
Displays model accuracy and performance  
Automatically saves results for each season  
User-friendly loop menu — runs until you decide to stop

## Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `smarter_stock_recommender.py` | Main Python program |
| `retail_store_inventory.csv` | Input data file containing inventory and sales data |
| `smart_stock_recommendations_<season>.csv` | Output files generated by the program (e.g., Summer, Winter) |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

---

## Data Requirements

The program uses a CSV file named **`retail_store_inventory.csv`** with the following columns:

| Column | Description | Example |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| `Date` | Date of record | 2024-07-15 |
| `Product ID` | Product name or unique identifier | P123 |
| `Units Sold` | Number of units sold | 25 |
| `Inventory Level` | Number of items currently in stock | 50 |
| `Demand Forecast` | *(Optional)* Predicted or estimated demand | 30 |

> Tip: Column names don’t need to match exactly — the program automatically normalizes them (for example, it handles spaces or capitalization differences).

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to install and run the program.

---

### Step 1: Install Python

If you don’t have Python installed, download it from:  
[https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

During installation, make sure to check the box **“Add Python to PATH.”**

---

### Step 2: Install Required Packages

Open your terminal or command prompt, go to your project folder, and run:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```
---

## Usage

1. Place your retail data CSV file as `retail_store_inventory.csv` in the project directory.
2. Run the program:

```bash
python ai_stock_recommender.py
```

3. Select a season when prompted:

```
1. Winter
2. Spring
3. Summer
4. Autumn
```

4. The program will output:

   * Top 5 predicted best-selling products.
   * Products selling quickly that may need restocking.
   * A business insight summary.
   * A CSV file with detailed recommendations: `smart_stock_recommendations_<season>.csv`.

---

## Data Format

Your `retail_store_inventory.csv` should include at least the following columns:

* `date` – The date of the sales record.
* `product_id` – Unique product identifier.
* `units_sold` – Number of units sold on that date.
* `inventory_level` – Current inventory level of the product.
* `demand_forecast` – (Optional) Precomputed forecast values.

Column names are normalized automatically, so minor variations are handled.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation:** Cleans and formats the dataset, extracts features like month, day of week, and season.
2. **Season Filtering:** Focuses analysis on the chosen season.
3. **Model Training:** Uses a Decision Tree Regressor to predict future sales based on historical trends.
4. **Restock Logic:** Calculates days of coverage and recommended reorder quantities to maintain optimal stock levels.
5. **Reporting:** Displays predictions in plain language and exports detailed CSV reports.

## Example Output

```
Top 5 Bestselling Products (Predicted Highest Demand):
• P123: Expected to sell about 50 units soon, 20 in stock → recommend ordering 80 more.
• P456: Expected to sell about 45 units soon, 15 in stock → recommend ordering 75 more.

Products Selling Fast and May Need Restocking Soon:
• P789: Selling quickly (30 units/day) with only 5 in stock → suggest ordering 55 more.

Business Insight Summary:
This analysis focuses on summer demand patterns.
It helps ensure you have enough stock for seasonal demand peaks, keeping about two weeks of stock ready.
